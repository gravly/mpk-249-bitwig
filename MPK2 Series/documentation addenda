PROGRAMMING NOTES

Bank A- Pad 1 is C2 = midi 36
Bank B, C, D just keep ascending from there.

'Bank' in MPK2_PadClipLaunch.js refers to whether tracks 1-4 or 5-8 are selected?

At the moment it does up to 8 tracks and up to 16 slots.
Could make it up to 16 tracks (Bank A, B, C, D) and up to 8 slots.

Tracks are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 (Bank A)
		    4, 5, 6, 7 (Bank B)

EXISTING
Say slot is 3(4) and track is 2(3)
newslot is then 0, Pad is then 2+0 = 2

Say slot is 2(3) and track is 1(2)
newslot is then 1, Pad is then 1+(1*4) = 5


WE WANT

newslot = Math.abs(track -3)
Pad = slot + (newslot * 4)

Say slot is 3(4) and track is 2(3)
newslot is then 1, Pad is then 3+(1*4) = 7

Say slot is 2(3) and track is 1(2)
newslot is then 2, Pad is then 2+(2*4) = 10

if track <8 then -7 from track.
If track is 6(7) and slot is 1(2)
newslot is then 1, Pad is then 5
